@** About this document.
This document is very much under construction,
enough so that readers may question why I make it
available at all.  Two reasons:
\li Despite its problems, it is the best way to read the source code
at this point.
\li Since it is essential to changing the code, not making it available
could be seen to violate the spirit of the open source.
@ This will eventually become a real book describing the
code.
Much rewriting and reorganization is needed for that
to happen.
\par
Marpa is a very unusual C library -- no system calls, no floating
point and almost no arithmetic.  A lot of data structures
and pointer twiddling.
I have found that a lot of good coding practices in other
contexts are not in this one.
\par
@ As one example, I intended to fully to avoid abbreviations.
This is good practice -- in most cases all abbreviations save is
some typing, at a very high cost in readability.
In |libmarpa|, however, spelling things out usually does
{\bf not} make them more readable.
To be sure, when I say
$$|To_AHFA_of_EIM_by_ISYID|$$
that is pretty incomprehensible.
But is
$$Aycock\_Horspool\_Finite\_Automaton\_To\_State\_of\_Earley\_Item\_by\_Internal\_Symbol\_ID$$
really any better?
\par
My experience say no.
I have a lot of practice coming back to pages of both, cold, 
and trying to figure them out.
Both are daunting, but the abbreviations are more elegant, and look
better on the page, while unabbreviated names routinely pose almost insoluble
problems for Cweb's \TeX{} typesetting.
\par
Whichever is used, it must be kept systematic and
documented, and that is easier with the abbreviations.
In general, I believe abbreviations are used in code
far more than they should be.  But they have their place
and |libmarpa| is one of them.
\par
Because I realized that abbreviations were going to be not
just better, but almost essential if I ever was to finish this
project, I changed from a ``no abbreviation" policy to one
of ``abbreviate when necessary and it is necessary a lot" half
way through.
Thus the code is highly inconsistent in this respect.
At the moment,
that's true of a lot of my other coding conventions.
\par
To summarize, the reader who has not yet been scared off,
needs to be aware that the coding conventions are not yet
consistent internally, and not yet consistent with their
documentation.
@
The Cweb is being written along with the code.
If the code works right off the bat, its accompanying text
will be a first draft.
The more trouble I had understanding an issue,
and writing the code,
the more thorough the documentation.

@** Design.
@*0 Layers.
|libmarpa|, the library described in this document, is intended as the bottom of potentially
four layers.
The layers are, from low to high
\li |libmarpa|
\li The glue layer
\li The wrapper layer
\li The application

This glue layer will be in C and will call the |libmarpa| routines
in a way that makes them compatible with another language.
I expect this will usually be a 4GL (4th generation language),
such as Perl.
One example of a glue description lanuage is SWIG.
Another is Perl XS, and currently that is
the only glue layer implemented for |libmarpa|.

|libmarpa| itself is not enormously user-
or application-friendly.
For example, in |libmarpa|, symbols do not have
names, just symbol structures and symbol ID's.
These are all that is needed for the data crunching,
but an application writer will usually want a friendlier
interface, including names for the symbols and
many other conveniences.
For this reason, applications will typically
use |libmarpa| through a {\bf wrapper package}.
Currently the only such package is in Perl.

The top layer is the application.
My expectation is that this will also be in a 4GL.
Currently, |libmarpa|'s only application are
in Perl.

Not all these layers need be present.
For example, it is conceivable that someone might
write their application in C, in which case they could
manage without minimal or no
glue layers or package layers.

Iterfaces between layers are named after the lower
of the two layers.  For example the interface between
|libmarpa| and the glue layer is the |libmarpa| interface.

@*1 Object pointers.
The major objects of the |libmarpa| layer are passed
to upper layers as pointer,
which hopefully will be treated as opaque.
|libmarpa| objects are reference-counted.

@*0 Inlining.
Most of this code in |libmarpa|
will be frequently executed.
Inlining is used a lot.
Enough so
that it is useful to define a macro to let me know when inlining is not
used in a private function.
@s PRIVATE_NOT_INLINE int
@s PRIVATE int
@d PRIVATE_NOT_INLINE static
@d PRIVATE static inline

@*0 Marpa global Setup.

Marpa has no globals as of this writing.
For thread-safety, among other reasons,
I'll try to keep it that way.

@*0 Complexity.
Considerable attention is paid to time and,
where it is a serious issue, space complexity.
Complexity is considered from three points of view.
{\bf Practical worst-case complexity} is the complexity of the
actual implementation, in the worst-case.
{\bf Practical average complexity} is the complexity of the
actual implementation under what are expected to be normal
circumstances.
Average complexity is of most interest to the typical user,
but worst-case considerations should not be ignored ---
in some applications,
one case of poor performance
can outweigh any number of
of excellent ``average case" results.
@ Finally, there is {\bf theoretical complexity}.
This is the complexity I would claim in a write-up of the
Marpa algorithm for a Theory of Computation article.
Most of the time, this is the same as practical worst-case complexity.
Often, however, for theoretical complexity I consider
myself entitled to claim
the time complexity for a 
better algorithm, even thought that is not the one
used in the actual implementation.
@ Sorting is a good example of under what circumstances
I take the liberty of claiming a time complexity I did not
implement.
In many places in |libmarpa|,
for sorting,
the most reasonable practical
implementation (sometimes the only reasonable practical implementation)
is an $O(n^2)$ sort.
When average list size is small, for example,
a hand-optimized insertion sort is often clearly superior
to all other alternatives.
Where average list size is larger,
a call to |qsort| is the appropriate response.
|qsort| is the result of considerable thought and experience,
the GNU project has decided to base it on quicksort,
and I do not care to second-guess them on this.
But quicksort and insertion sorts are both, theoretically, $O(n^2)$.
@ Clearly, in both cases, I could drop in a merge sort and achieve
a theoretical $O(n \log n)$ worst case.
Often just as clear is that is all cases likely to occur in practice,
the merge sort would be inferior.
@ When I claim a complexity from a theoretical choice of algorithm,
rather than the actually implemented one, the following will always be
the case:
\li The existence of the theoretical algorithm must be generally accepted.
\li The complexity I claim for it must be generally accepted.
\li It must be clear that there are no obstacles to using the theoretical algorithm
whose solution is not straightforward.
@ I am a big believer in theory.
Often practical considerations didn't clearly indicate a choice of
algorithm .
In those circumstances, I usually
allowed theoretical superiority to be the deciding factor.
@ But there were cases
where the theoretically superior choice
was clearly going to be inferior in practice.
Sorting was one of them.
It would be possible to
go through |libmarpa| and replace all sorts with a merge sort.
But a slower library would be the result.

@** Coding conventions.

@*0 External functions.

All libmarpa's external functions,
without exception, begin with the
prefix |marpa_|.
All libmarpa's external functions
fall into one of three classes:
\li Version-number-related
function follow GNU naming conventions.
\li The functions for libmarpa's obstacks
have name with the prefix |marpa_obs_|.
These are not part of libmarpa's external interface,
but so they do have external linkage so that they
can be compiled separately.
\li Function for one of libmarpa's objects,
which begin with the prefix
|marpa_X_|,
where |X| is a one-letter code
which designates one of libmarpa's objects.
\par

@*0 Objects.

When I find it useful,
libmarpa 
uses an object-oriented approach.
One such case is the classification
and naming of external functions.
This can be seen as giving libmarpa an object-oriented
structure, overall.
The classes of object used by libmarpa have one letter codes.

\li g: grammar.
\li r: recognizer.
\li b: bocage.
\li o: ordering.
\li t: tree.
\li v: evaluator.

@*0 Reserved locals.
Certain symbol names are reserved for certain purposes.
They are not necessarily defined, but if defined,
and once initialized,
they
must be used for the designated purpose.
An example is |g|, which is the grammar of most interest in
the context.
(In fact, no marpa routine uses more than one grammar.)
It is expected that the routines which refer to a grammar
will set |g| to that value.
This convention saves a lot of clutter in the form of
macro and subroutine arguments.

\li |g| is the grammar of most interest in the context.
\li |r| is the recognizer of most interest in the context.
\li |irl_count| is the number of internal rules in |g|.
\li |xrl_count| is the number of external rules in |g|.

@*0 Mixed case macros.
In programming in general, accessors are very common.
In |libmarpa|, the percentage of the logic the consists
of accessors is even higher than usual,
and their variety approaches the botanical.
Most of these accessors are simple or even trivial,
but some are not.
In an effort to make the code readable and maintainable,
I use macros for all accessors.
@ The standard C convention is that macros are all caps.
This is a good convention.  I believe in it and usually
follow it.
But in this code I have departed from it.
@ As has been noted in the email world,
when most of a page is in caps, that page becomes
much harder and less pleasant to read.
So in this code I have made macros mixed case.
Marpa's mixed case macros are easy to spot ---
they always start with a capital, and the ``major words"
also begin in capital letters.
``Verbs" and ``coverbs" in the macros begin with a lower
case letter.
All words are separated with an underscore,
as is the currently accepted practice to enhance readability.
@ The ``macros are all caps" convention is a long standing one.
I understand that experienced C programmers will be suspicious
of my claim that this code is special in a way that justifies
breaking the convention.
Frankly, if I were a new reader coming to this code,
I would be suspicious as well.
But I would ask anyone who wishes to criticize to first do
the following:
Look at one of the many macro-heavy pages in this code
and ask yourself -- do you genuinely wish more of this
page was in caps?

@*0 External names.
External Names have |marpa_| or |MARPA_| as their prefix,
as appropriate under the capitalization conventions.
Many names begin with one of the major ``objects" of Marpa:
grammars, recognizers, symbols, etc.
Names of functions typically end with a verb.

@*0 Booleans.
Names of booleans are often
of the form |is_x|, where |x| is some
property.  For example, the element of the symbol structure
which indicates whether the symbol is a terminal or not,
is |is_terminal|.
Boolean names are chosen so that the true or false
value corresponds correctly to the question implied by the
name.
Names should be as
accurate as possible consistent with brevity.
Where possible, consistent with brevity and accuracy,
positive names (|is_found|) are preferred
to negative names (|is_not_lost|).

@*0 Abbreviations and vocabulary.
@ Unexplained abbreviations and non-standard vocabulary
pose unnecessary challenges.
Particular obstacles to those who are not native speakers
of English, they are annoying to the natives as well.
This section is intended to document
all abbreviations.
Also included is the
any non-standard vocabulary 
which is not explained in detail elsewhere in the
text.
By ``non-standard vocabulary",
I mean terms that
are not in a general dictionary, and
are also not in the standard reference works.
@ While development is underway, this section will be
incomplete and sometimes inaccurate.
\li alloc: Allocate.
\li assign: Find something, creating it when necessary.
\li bv: Bit Vector.
\li cmp: Compare.
Usually as |_cmp|, the suffix or ``verb" of a function name.
\li \_Object: As a suffix of a type name, this means an object,
as opposed to a pointer.
When there is a choice,
most complex types are considered to be pointers
to structures or unions, rather than the structure or
union itself.
When it's necessary to have a type which
refers to the actual structure
or union {\bf directly}, not via a pointer,
that type is called the ``object" form of the
type.  As an example, look at the definitions
of |EIM| and |EIM_Object|.
\li EIM: Earley item.
\li |EIM_Object|: Earley item (object).
\li EIX: Earley item index.
\li ES: Earley set.
\li g: Grammar.
\li |_ix|, |_IX|, ix, IX: Index.  Often used as a suffix.
\li Leo base item: The Earley item which ``causes" a Leo item to
be added.  If a Leo chain in reconstructed from the Leo item,
\li Leo completion item: The Earley item which is the ``successor"
of a Leo item to
be added.
\li Leo LHS symbol: The LHS of a Leo completion item (see which).
\li Leo item: A ``transition item" as described in Leo1991.
These stand in for a Leo chain of one or more Earley tems.
Leo items can stand in for all the Earley items of a right
recursion,
and it is the use of Leo items which makes this algorithm |O(n)|
for all LR-regular grammars.
In an Earley implementation
without Leo items, a parse with right recursion
can have the time comlexity |O(n^2)|.
\li LIM: Leo item.
\li \_Object: Suffix indicating that the type is of an
actual object, and not a pointer as is usually the case.
\li PIM, pim: Postdot item.
\li p: A Pointer.  Often as |_p|, as the end of a variable name, or as |p_| at
the beginning of one.
\li pp: A Pointer to pointer.  Often as |_pp|, as the end of a variable name.
\li R, r: Recognizer.
\li RECCE, recce: Recognizer.  Originally military slang for a
reconnaissance.
\li -s, -es: Plural.  Note that the |es| suffix is often used even when
it is not good English, because it is easier to spot in text.
For example, the plural of |ES| is |ESes|.
\li |s_|: Prefix for a structure tag.  Cweb does not C code format well
unless tag names are distinct from other names.
\li |t_|: Prefix for an element tag.  Cweb does not C code format well
unless tag names are distinct from others.
Since each structure and union in C has a different namespace,
this does not suffice to make different tags unique, but it does
suffice to let Cweb distinguish tags from other items, and that is the
object.
\li |u_|: Prefix for a union tag.  Cweb does not C code format well
unless tag names are distinct from other names.

@** Maintenance notes.

@*0 Where is the source?.

Most of the source code for |libmarpa| in the
Cweb file |marpa.w|,
which is also the source for this document.
But error codes and public function prototypes
are taken from |api.texi|,
the API document.
(This helps
keep the API documentation in sync with
the source code.)
To change error codes or public function
prototypes, look at 
|api.texi| and the scripts which process it.

@*0 The grammar's size.
Intuitively,
I define a grammar's size as the total size, in symbols, of all of its

Since every rule has exactly one LHS symbol,
the grammar's size is always equal to the total of
all the rules lengths, plus the total number of rules.

@*0 Terminal boolean vector.
A boolean vector, with bits sets if the symbol is a

This is not used as the working vector while doing

Obstacks with the same lifetime as the grammar.
This is a very efficient way of allocating memory which won't be
resized and which will have the same lifetime as the grammar.
The XRL obstack is dedicated to XRL's, which it is convenient
to build on the obstack.
A dedicated obstack ensures that an in-process XRL will not
be overwritten by code using the obstack for other objects.
A side benefit is that the dedicated
XRL obstack can be specially
aligned.

@*0 The "is OK" word.
The grammar needs a flag for a fatal error.
This is an |int| for defensive coding reasons.
Since I am paying the code of an |int|,
I also use this word as a sanity test ---
testing that arguments that are passed
as Marpa grammars actually do point to
properly initialized
Marpa grammars.
It is also possible this will catch certain
memory overwrites.
@ The word is placed first, because references
to the first word of a bogus pointer
are the most likely to be handled without
a memory access error.
Also, there it is somewhat more
likely to catch memory overwrite errors.
|0x69734f4b| is the ASCII for 'isOK'.

@*0 The grammar's error ID.
This is an error flag for the grammar.
Error status is not necessarily cleared
on successful return, so that
it is only valid when an external
function has indicated there is an error,
and becomes invalid again when another external method
is called on the grammar.
Checking it at other times may reveal ``stale" error
messages.

much.

@ Does this rule duplicate an already existing rule?
A duplicate is a rule with the same lhs symbol,
the same rhs length,
and the same symbol in each position on the rhs.
BNF rules are prevented from duplicating sequence
rules because sequence LHS's are required to be
unique.

The order of the sort function is for convenience
in computation.
All that matters is that identical rules sort the
same and otherwise the order does not need to
make sense.

I do not think the
restrictions on sequence rules represent real limitations.
Multiple sequences with the same lhs and rhs would be
very confusing.
And users who really, really want such them are free
to write the sequences out as BNF rules.
After all, sequence rules are only a shorthand.
And shorthand is counter-productive when it makes
you lose track of what you are trying to say.

@*0 Rule symbols.
A rule takes the traditiona form of
a left hand side (LHS), and a right hand side (RHS).
The {\bf length} of a rule is the length of the RHS ---
there is always exactly one LHS symbol.
Maximum length of the RHS is restricted.
I take off two more bits than necessary, as a fudge
factor.
This is only checked for new rules.
The rules generated internally by libmarpa
are either shorter than
a small constant in length, or
else shorter than the XRL which is their
source.
On a 32-bit machine, this still allows a RHS of over a billion
symbols.
I believe
by the time 64-bit machines become universal,
nobody will have noticed this restriction.

@*0 Rule has proper separation?.
In Marpa's terminology,
proper separation means that a sequence
cannot legally end with a separator.
In ``proper" separation,
the term separator is interpreted strictly,
as something which separates two list items.
A separator coming after the final list item does not separate
two items, and therefore traditionally was considered a syntax
error.
\par
Proper separation is often inconvenient,
or even counter-productive.
Increasingly, the
practice is to be ``liberal"
and to allow a separator to come after the last list
item.
Liberal separation is the default in Marpa.
\par
There is not bitfield for this, because proper separation is
a completely syntactic matter,
taken care of in the rewrite itself.

@*0 IRL has virtual LHS?.
This is for Marpa's ``internal semantics".
When Marpa rewrites rules, it does so in a way invisible to
the user's semantics.
It does this by marking rules so that it can reassemble
the results of rewritten rules to appear ``as if"
they were the result of evaluating the original,
un-rewritten rule.
\par
All Marpa's rewrites allow the rewritten rules to be
``dummied up" to look like the originals.
That this must be possible for any rewrite was one of
Marpa's design criteria.
It was an especially non-negotiable criteria, because
almost the only reason for parsing a grammar is to apply the
semantics specified for the original grammar.

@** Precomputing the grammar.
Marpa's logic divides roughly into three pieces -- grammar precomputation,
the actual parsing of input tokens,
and semantic evaluation.
Precomputing the grammar is complex enough to divide into several
stages of its own, which are 
covered in the next few
sections.
This section describes the top-level method for precomputation,
which is external.
@ If |marpa_g_precompute| is called on a precomputed
grammar, the upper layers have a lot of latitude.
There's no harm done, so the upper layers can simply ignore this one.
On the other hand, the upper layer may see this as a sign of a major
logic error, and treat it as a fatal error.
Anything in between these two extremes is also possible.

@** The grammar census.

@*0 Implementation: inacessible and unproductive Rules.
The textbooks say that,
in order to automatically {\bf eliminate} inaccessible and unproductive
productions from a grammar, you have to first eliminate the
unproductive productions, {\bf then} the inaccessible ones.

In practice, this advice does not seem very helpful.
Imagine the (quite possible) case
of an unproductive start symbol.
Following the
correct procedure for automatically cleaning the grammar, I would
have to regard the start symbol and its productions as eliminated
and therefore go on to report every other production and symbol as
inaccessible.  Almost certainly all these inaccessiblity reports,
while theoretically correct, would be irrelevant.
What the user probably wants to
is to make the start symbol productive.

In |libmarpa|,
inaccessibility is determined based on the assumption that
unproductive symbols will be make productive somehow,
and not eliminated.
The downside of this choice is that, in a few uncommon cases,
a user relying entirely
on the Marpa::R2 warnings to clean up his grammar will have to go through
more than a single pass of the diagnostics.
(As of this writing, I personally have yet to encounter such a case.)
The upside is that in the more frequent cases, the user is spared
a lot of useless diagnostics.

This logic could be put earlier, and a child array

the initialization for the calculation of the reach

A rule-child array is a list of the rule's RHS symbols,

There are places were traversing a rule-child array,
instead of the rhs, would be more efficient.
At this point,

@** The CHAF rewrite.

Nullable symbols have been a difficulty for Earley implementations
since day zero.
Aycock and Horspool came up with a solution to this problem,
part of which involved rewriting the grammar to eliminate
all proper nullables.
Marpa's CHAF rewrite is built on the work of Aycock and
Horspool.

Marpa's CHAF rewrite is one of its two rewrites of the BNF.
The other
adds a new start symbol to the grammar.

@ The rewrite strategy for Marpa is new to it.
It is an elaboration on the one developed by Aycock and Horspool.
The basic idea behind Aycock and Horspool's NNF was to elimnate
proper nullables by replacing the rules with variants which
used only nulling and non-nulling symbols.
These had to be created for every possible combination
of nulling and non-nulling symbols.
This meant that the number of NNF rules was
potentially exponential
in the length of rule of the original grammar.

@ Marpa's CHAF (Chomsky-Horspool-Aycock Form) eliminates
the problem of exponential explosion by first breaking rules
up into pieces, each piece containing no more than two proper nullables.
The number of rewritten rules in CHAF in linear in the length of
the original rule.

@ The CHAF rewrite affects only rules with proper nullables.
In this context, the proper nullables are called ``factors".
Each piece of the original rule is rewritten into up to four
``factored pieces".
When there are two proper nullables, the potential CHAF rules
are
\li The PP rule:  Both factors are replaced with non-nulling symbols.
\li The PN rule:  The first factor is replaced with a non-nulling symbol,
and the second factor is replaced with a nulling symbol.
\li The NP rule: The first factor is replaced with a nulling symbol,
and the second factor is replaced with a non-nulling symbol.
\li The NN rule: Both factors are replaced with nulling symbols.

@ Sometimes the CHAF piece will have only one factor.  A one-factor
piece is rewritten into at most two factored pieces:
\li The P rule:  The factor is replaced with a non-nulling symbol.
\li The N rule:  The factor is replaced with a nulling symbol.

@ In |CHAF_rewrite|, a |rule_count| is taken before the loop over
the grammar's rules, even though rules are added in the loop.
This is not an error.
The CHAF rewrite is not recursive -- the new rules it creates
are not themselves subject to CHAF rewrite.
And rule ID's increase by one each time,
so that all the new
rules will have ID's equal to or greater than
the pre-CHAF rule count.

@** Loops.
Loops are rules which non-trivially derive their own LHS.
More precisely, a rule is a loop if and only if it
non-trivially derives a string which contains its LHS symbol
and is of length 1.
In my experience,
and according to Grune and Jacobs 2008 (pp. 48-49),
loops are never of practical use.

@ Marpa allows loops, for two reasons.
First, I want to be able to claim that
Marpa handles {\bf all} context-free grammars.
This is of real value to the user, because
it makes
it very easy for her
to know beforehand whether Marpa can
handle a particular grammar.
If she can write the grammar in BNF, then Marpa can handle it ---
it's that simple.
For Marpa to make this claim,
it must be able to handle grammars
with loops.

Second, a user's drafts of a grammar might contain cycles.
A parser generator which did not handle them would force
the user's first order of business to be removing them.
That might be inconvenient.

@ The grammar precomputations and the recognition
phase have been set up so that
loops are a complete non-issue --- they are dealt with like
any other situation, without additional overhead.
However, loops do impose overhead and require special
handling in the evaluation phase.
It is unlikely that a user will want to leave one in
a production grammar.

@ Marpa detects all loops during its grammar
precomputation.
|libmarpa| assumes that parsing will go through as usual,
with the loops.
But it enables the upper layers to make other choices.
@ The higher layers can differ greatly in their treatment
of loop rules.  It is perfectly reasonable for a higher layer to treat a loop
rule as a fatal error.
It is also reasonable for a higher layer to always silently allow them.
There are lots of possibilities in between these two extremes.
To assist the upper layers, an event is reported for a non-zero
loop rule count, with the final tally.

@** The Aycock-Horspool finite automata.

@*0 Some statistics on AHFA states.
For Perl's grammar, the discovered states range in size from 1 to 20 items,
but the numbers are heavily skewed toward the low
end.  Here are the item counts that appear, with the percent of the total
discovered AHFA states with that item count in parentheses.
in parentheses:
1   (67.05\%);
2   (25.67\%);
3   (2.87\%);
4   (2.68\%);
5   (0.19\%);
6   (0.38\%);
7   (0.19\%);
8   (0.57\%);
9   (0.19\%); and
20   (0.19\%).

@ As can be seen, well over 90\% of the total discovered states have
just one or two items.
The average size is 1.5235,
and the average of the $|size|^2$ is 3.9405.

@ For the HTML grammars I used, the totals are even more lopsided:
80.96\% of all discovered states have only 1 item.
All the others (19.04\%) have 2 items.
The average size is 1.1904,
and the average of the $|size|^2$ is 1.5712.

@ The number of predicted states tends to be much more
evenly distributed.
It also tends to be much larger, and
the average for practical grammars may be $O(s)$,
where $s$ is the size of the grammar.
This is the same as the theoretical worst case.

Here are the number of items for predicted states for the Perl grammar.
The number of states with that item count in is parentheses:
1 item (3),
2 items (5),
3 items (4),
4 items (3),
5 items (1),
6 items (2),
7 items (2),
64 items (1),

@** AHFA item (AIM) code.

AHFA items are named by analogy with LR(0) items.

AHFA items play in the AHFA ---
the states of the automata correspond to sets of the items.
Also like LR(0) items,
each AHFA items correponds one-to-one to a duple,
the duple being a a rule and a position in that rule.

@** AHFA state (AHFA) code.

This algorithm to create the AHFA states is new with |libmarpa|.
It is based on noting that the states to be created fall into
distinct classes, and that considerable optimization is possible
if the classes of AHFA states are optimized separately.
@ In their paper Aycock and Horspool divide the states of their
automaton into
call non-kernel and kernel states.
In the AHFA, kernel states are called discovered AHFA states.
Non-kernel states are called predicted AHFA states.
If an AHFA states contains a start rule or
or an AHFA item for which at least some
non-nulling symbol has been recognized,
it is an {\bf discovered} AHFA state.
Otherwise, the AHFA state will contain only predictions,
and is a {\bf predicted} AHFA state.
@ Predicted AHFA states are so called because they only contain
items which predict, according to the grammar,
what might be found in the input.
Discovered AHFA states are so called because either they ``report"
the start of the input
or they ``report" symbols actually found in the input.
@ {\bf The Initial AHFA State}:
This is the only state which can
contain an AHFA item for a null rule.
It only takes one of three possible forms.
Listing the reasons that it makes sense to special-case
this class would take more space than the code to do it.
@ {\bf The Initial AHFA Prediction State}:
This state is paired with a special-cased state, so it would
require going out of our way to {\bf not} special-case this
state as well.
It does
share with the other initial state that property that it is not
necessary to check to ensure it does not duplicate an existing
state.
Other than that, the code is much like that to create any other
prediction state.
@ {\bf Discovered States with 1 item}:
These may be specially optimized for.
Sorting the items can be dispensed with.
Checking for duplicates can be done using an array indexed by
the ID of the only AHFA item.
Statistics for practical grammars show that most discovered states
contain only a single AHFA item, so there is a big payoff from
special-casing these.
@ {\bf Discovered States with 2 or more items}:
For non-singleton discovered states,
I use a hand-written insertion sort,
and check for duplicates using a hash with a customized key.
Further optimizations are possible, but
few discovered states fall into this case.
Also, discovered states of 2 items are a large enough class to justify
separating out, if a significant optimization for them could be
found.
@ {\bf Predicted States}:
These are treated differently from discovered states.
The items in these are always a subset of the initial items for rules,
and therefore correspond one-to-one with a powerset of the rules.
This fact is used in precomputing rule boolean vectors, by postdot symbol,
to speed up the construction of these.
An advantage of using boolean vectors is that a radix sort of the items
happens as a side effect.
Because prediction states follow a very different distribution from
discovered states, they have their own hash for checking duplicates.

@<Public typedefs@> =
typedef int Marpa_AHFA_State_ID;

@ {\bf Estimating the number of AHFA States}: Based on the numbers given previously
for Perl and HTML,
$2s$ is a good high-ball estimate of the number of AHFA states for
grammars of practical interest,
where $s$ is the size of the grammar.
I come up with this as follows.

Let the size of an AHFA state be the number of AHFA items it contains.
\li It is impossible for the number of AHFA items to greater than
the size of the grammar.
\li It is impossible for the number of discovered states of size 1
to be greater than the number of AHFA items.
\li The number of discovered states of size 2 or greater
will typically be half the number of discovered states of size 1,
or less.
\li The number of predicted states will typically be
considerably less than half the number of discovered states.

The three possibilities just enumerated exhaust the possibilities for AHFA states.
The total is ${s \over 2} + {s \over 2} + s = 2s$.
Typically, the number of AHFA states should be less than this estimate.

@* Discovered AHFA states.
@ {\bf Theorem}:
An AHFA state that contains a start rule completion is always
a 1-item discovered state.
{\bf Proof}:
The grammar is augmented,
so that no other rule predicts a start rule.
This means that AHFA state 0 will contain the only predicted
start rule.
AHFA state 0 contains the predicted start rule.
@ The form of the non-null predicted start rule
is $S' \leftarrow \cdot S$,
where $S'$ is the augmented start symbol and $S$ was
the start symbol in the original grammar.
This rule will be the only transition out of AHFA state 0.
Call the to-state of this transition, state $n$.
State $n$ will clearly contain a completed start rule
( $S' \leftarrow S \cdot$ ),
which will be rule for the only AHFA item in AHFA state $n$.
\par
Since only state 0 contains 
$S' \leftarrow \cdot S$,
only AHFA state $n$ will contain 
$S' \leftarrow S \cdot$.
Therefore there is only one AHFA state containing
a start rule completion, and it is a
1-item discovered AHFA states.

@
Assuming this is a 1-item completion, mark this state as
a Leo completion if the last non-nulling symbol is on a LHS.
(This eliminates rule which end in a terminal-only symbol from
consideration in the Leo logic.)
We know that there is a non-nulling symbol, because there is
one is every non-nulling rule, the only non-nulling rule will
be in AHFA state 0, and AHFA state 0 is
handled as a special cases.
\par
As a note, the current logic makes an item an leo completion
if the last non-nulling symbol is on a LHS.
With a bit more trouble, I could determine
which rules are right-recursive.
I would need to compute a transitive closure on the relationship
``X right-derives Y" and then consider a state to be
a Leo completion
only if the LHS of the rule in its only item right-derives its
last non-nulling symbol.

@ The expression below takes the first (and only) item in
the current state, and finds its closest previous non-nulling
symbol.
This will be the postdot symbol of the AHFA item just prior,
which can be found by simply decrementing the pointer.
If the predot symbol of an item is on the LHS of any rule,
then that state is a Leo completion.
@<If this state can be a Leo completion,
set the Leo completion symbol to |lhs_id|@> =
{
  AIM previous_ahfa_item = single_item_p - 1;
  ISYID predot_isyid = Postdot_ISYID_of_AIM (previous_ahfa_item);
  if (ISY_is_LHS(ISY_by_ID (predot_isyid)))
    {
      Leo_LHS_ISYID_of_AHFA (p_new_state) = lhs_isyid;
    }
}

@ Discovered AHFA states are usually quite small
and the insertion sort here is probably optimal for the usual cases.
It is $O(n^2)$ for the large AHFA states, but at present there is
little value in coding for such cases.
Average complexity -- probably $O(1)$.
Implemented worst-case complexity: $O(n^2)$.
Theoretical complexity: $O(n \log n)$, because another sort can easily be
substituted for the insertion sort.
\par
Note the mixture of indexing and old-fashioned pointer twiddling
in the insertion sort.
I am usually of the opinion that the pointer twiddling should be left
to the optimizer, but in this case I think that a little bit of
pointer twiddling actually makes the code clearer than it would
be if written 100\% using indexes.

@*0 Predicted AHFA states.
The method for building predicted AHFA states is optimized using
precomputed boolean vectors.
This should be very fast,
but it is possible to think other methods might
be better, at least in some cases.  The boolean vectors are $O(s)$ in length, where $s$ is the
size of the grammar, and so is the time complexity of the method used.
@ It may be possible to look at a list of
only the AHFA items actually present in each state,
which might be $O(\log s)$ in the average case.  An advantage of the boolean vectors is they
implicitly perform a radix sort.
This would have to be performed explicitly for an enumerated
list of AHFA items, making the putative average case $O(\log s \cdot \log \log s)$.
@ In the worst case, however, the number of AHFA items in the predicted states is
$O(s)$, making the time complexity
of a list solution, $O(s \cdot \log s)$.
In normal cases,
the practical advantages of boolean vectors are overwhelming and swamp the theoretical
time complexity.
The advantage of listing AHFA items is restricted to a putative ``average" case,
and even there would not kick in until the grammars became very large.
My conclusion is that alternatives to the boolean vector implementation deserve
further investigation, but that at present, and overall,
boolean vectors appear clearly superior to the alternatives.
@ For the predicted states, I construct a symbol-by-rule matrix
of predictions.  First, I determine which symbols directly predict
others.  Then I compute the transitive closure.
Finally, I convert this to a symbol-by-rule matrix.
The symbol-by-rule matrix will be used in constructing the prediction
states.

    }
}

@ At this point I have a full matrix showing which symbol implies a prediction
of which others.  To save repeated processing when building the AHFA prediction states,
I now convert it into a matrix from symbols to the rules they predict.
Specifically, if symbol |S1| predicts symbol |S2|, then symbol |S1|
predicts every rule
with |S2| on its LHS.

final result we want the keys to be unique integers

so that they can be used as the indices of a boolean vector.

@** Transition (TRANS) code.
This code deals with data which is accessed
as a function of AHFA state and symbol.
The most important data
of this type are the AHFA state transitions,
which is why the per-AHFA-per-symbol data is called
``transition" data.
But per-AHFA symbol completion data is also
a function of AHFA state and symbol.
@ This operation is at the heart of the parse engine,
and worth a careful look.
Speed is probably optimal.
Time complexity is fine --- $O(1)$ in the length of the input.
@ But this solution is is very space-intensive---%
perhaps $O(\v g\v^2)$.
But these arrays are extremely sparse,
Many rows of the array have only one or two entries.
There are alternatives
which save a lot of space in return for a small overhead in time.
@ A very similar problem has been the subject of considerable
study---%
LALR and LR(0) state tables.
These also index by state and symbol, and their usage is very
similar to that expected for the AHFA lookups.
@ Bison's solution is probably worth study.
This is a kind of perfect hashing, and quite complex.
I do wonder if it would not be over-engineering
in the libmarpa context.
In practical applications, a binary search, or even
a linear search,
may have be fastest implementation for
the average case.
@ The trend is for memory to get cheap,
favoring the sparse 2-dimensional array
which is the present solution.
But I expect the trend will also be for grammars to get larger.
This would be a good issue to run some benchmarks on,
once I stabilize the C code implemention.

@*0 Leo-related booleans.
@*1 Turning Leo logic off and on.
A trace flag, set if we are using Leo items.
This flag is set by default.
It has two uses.
@ This flag is very useful for testing.
Since Leo items do not affect function, only effiency,
it is possible for the Leo logic to be broken or
disabled without most tests noticiing.
To make sure the Leo logic is intact,
one of |libmarpa|'s tests runs one pass
with Leo items off and another with Leo items on
and compares them.
@ This flag also allows the Leo logic
to be turned off in certain cases in which the Leo logic
actually slows things down.
The Leo logic could be turned off if the user knows there is
no right recursion, although the actual gain,
would typically be small or not measurable.
@ A real gain would occur in the case of highly ambiguous
grammars, all or most of whose parses are actually evaluated.
Since those Earley items eliminated by the Leo logic
are actually recreated on an as-needed basis in the evaluation
phase, in cases when most of the Earley items are needed
for evaluation, the Leo logic would be eliminated Earley
items only to have to add most of them later.
In these cases,
the Leo logic would impose a small overhead.
@ The author's current view is that it is best
to start by assuming that the Leo logic should
be left on.
In the rare event, that it turns out that the Leo
logic is counter-productive,
this flag can be used to test if turning the Leo
logic off is helpful.
@ It should be borne in mind that even when the Leo logic
imposes a small cost in typical cases,
it may act as a safeguard.
The time complexity explosions prevented by Leo logic can
easily mean the difference between an impractical computation
and a practical one.
In most applications, it is worth incurring an small
overhead in the average case to prevent failures,
even rare ones.
@ There are two booleans.
One is a flag that can be set and
unset externally,
indicating the application's intention to use Leo logic.
An internal boolean tracks whether the Leo logic is
actually enabled at any given point.
@ The reason for having two booleans
is that the Leo logic is only turned
on once Earley set 0 is complete.
While Earley set 0 is being processed the internal flag will always
be unset, while the external flag may be set or unset, as the user
decided.
After Earley set 0 is complete, both booleans will have the same value.

@*1 Is the parser exhausted?.
A parser is ``exhausted" if it cannot accept any more input.
Both successful and failed parses can be ``exhausted".
In many grammars,
the parse is always exhausted as soon as it succeeds.
And even if the parse is exhausted at a point
where there is no good parse, 
there may be good parses at earlemes prior to the
earleme at which the parse became exhausted.

{
  R_is_Exhausted (r) = 1;
  Input_Phase_of_R (r) = R_AFTER_INPUT;
  event_new (g, MARPA_EVENT_EXHAUSTED);
}

@ Exhaustion is a boolean, not a phase.
Once exhausted a parse stays exhausted,
even though the phase may change.

int marpa_r_is_exhausted(Marpa_Recognizer r)

@*0 The recognizer obstack.

This is a very efficient way of allocating memory which won't be
resized and which will have the same lifetime as the recognizer.

@ @<Initialize recognizer obstack@> = r->t_obs = my_obstack_init;
@ @<Destroy recognizer obstack@> = my_obstack_free(r->t_obs);

@** Earlemes.
In most parsers, the input is modeled as a token stream ---
a sequence of tokens.
In this model the idea of location is not complex.
The first token is at location 0, the second at location 1,
etc.
@ Marpa allows ambiguous and variable length tokens, and requires
a more flexible idea of location, with a unit of length.
The unit of token length in Marpa is called an Earleme.
The locations themselves are often called earlemes.
@ |EARLEME_THRESHOLD| is less than |INT_MAX| so that
I can prevent overflow without getting fancy -- overflow
by addition is impossible as long as earlemes are below
the threshold.
@ I considered defining earlemes as |long| or
explicitly as 64-bit integers.
But machines with 32-bit int's
will in a not very long time
become museum pieces.
And in the meantime this
definition of |EARLEME_THRESHOLD| probably allows as large as
parse as the memories on those machines will be
able to handle.

@** Earley item (EIM) code.
@ {\bf Optimization Principles:}
\li Optimization should favor unambiguous grammars,
but not heavily penalize ambiguous grammars.
\li Optimization should favor mildly ambiguous grammars,
but not heavily penalize very ambiguous grammars.
\li Optimization should focus on saving space,
perhaps even if at a slight cost in time.
@ Space savings are important
because in practical applications
there can easily be many millions of
Earley items and links.
If there are 1M copies of a structure,
each byte saved is a 1M saved.

@ The solution arrived at is to optimize for Earley items
with a single source, storing that source in the item
itself.
For Earley item with multiple sources, a special structure
of linked lists is used.
When a second source is added,
the first source is copied into the lists,
and its original space used for pointers to the linked
lists.
@ This solution is optimized both
for the unambiguous case,
and for adding the third and additional
sources.
The only awkwardness takes place
when the second source is added, and the first one must
be recopied to make way for pointers to the linked lists.

in the trace Earley set with the specified
AHFA state ID and origin earleme.
If there is no such Earley item,
it returns |-1|,

On failure for other reasons,
it returns |-2|,

The trace source link is always
cleared, regardless of success or failure.

@ This function sets
the trace Earley set to the one indicated
by the ID
of the argument.
On success,
the earleme of the new trace Earley set is
returned.
@ Various other trace data depends on the Earley
set, and must be consistent with it.
This function clears all such data,
unless it is called while the recognizer is in
a trace-unsafe state (initial, fatal, etc.)
or unless the the Earley set requested by the
argument is already the trace Earley set.
On failure because the ID is for a non-existent
Earley set which does not
exist, |-1| is returned.
The upper levels may choose to treat this as a soft failure.
This may be treated as a soft failure by the upper levels.
On failure because the ID is illegal (less than zero)

@** Source objects.
These are distinguished by context.
@*0 The relationship between Leo items and ambiguity.
The relationship between Leo items and ambiguous sources bears
some explaining.
Leo sources must be unique, but only when their predecessor's
Earley set is considered.
That is, for every pairing of Earley item and Earley set,
if there be only one Leo source in that Earley item
with a predecessor in that Earley set.
But there may be other sources (both Leo and non-Leo),
a long as their predecessors
are in different Earley sets.
@ One way to look at these Leo ambiguities is as different
``factorings" of the Earley item.
Assume the last (or transition) symbol of an Earley item
is a token.
An Earley item will often have both a predecessor and a token,
and these can ``factor", or divide up, the distance between
an Earley item's origin and its current set in different ways.
@ The Earley item can have only one origin,
and only one transition symbol.
But that transition symbol does not have to start at the origin
and can start anywhere between the origin and the current
set of the Earley item.
For example, for an Earley item at earleme 14, with its origin at 10,
tokens may start at earlemes 10, 11, 12 and 13.
Each may have its own Leo source.
At those earlemes without a Leo source, there may be any number
of non-Leo sources.
@ In this way, an Earley item with a Leo source can be ambiguous.
The discussion above assumed the final symbol was a token.
The situation for completion Earley items is similar,
and these also can both have a Leo source and 
be ambiguous.
@*0 Optimization.
There will be a lot of these structures in a long
parse, so space optimization is important.
I have some latitude in the number of linked lists
in a ambiguous source.
If an |int| is the same size as a |void*|,
then space for three |void*| in ambiguous sources
comes ``free".
If |void*| is $n$ bytes larger than an |int|,
then each unambiguous source uses $n$ bytes
more than it has to, although there are
compensating improvements in
speed and simplicity.
Any programmer trying to take advantage
of architectures where |int|
is shorter than |void*| will need to
assure herself that the space she saves in 
the |ambiguous_source| struct was not simply wasted
by alignment within structures or during memory allocation.

@
Each possible cause
link is only visited once.
It may be paired with several different predecessors.
Each cause may complete several different LHS symbols
and Marpa::R2 will seek predecessors for each at
the parent location.
Two different completed LHS symbols might be postdot
symbols for the same predecessor Earley item.
For this reason,
predecessor-cause pairs
might not be unique
within an Earley item.
@ Since a completion link consists entirely of
the predecessor-cause pair, this means duplicate
completion links are possible.
The maximum possible number of such duplicates is the
number of complete LHS symbols for the current AHFA state.
This is alway a constant and typically a small one,
but it is also typically larger than 1.
@ This is not an issue for unambiguous parsing.
It {\bf is} an issue for iterating ambiguous parses.
The strategy currently taken is to do nothing about duplicates
in the recognition phase,
and to eliminate them in the evaluation phase.
Ultimately, duplicates must be eliminated by rule and
position -- eliminating duplicates by AHFA state is
{\bf not} sufficient.
Since I do not pull out the
individual rules and positions until the evaluation phase,
at this writing it seems to make sense to deal with
duplicates there.
@ As shown above, the number of duplicate completion links
is never more than $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of Earley items.
For academic purposes, it
is probably possible to contrive a parse which generates
a lot of duplicates.
The actual numbers
I have encountered have always been very small,
even in grammars of only academic interest.
@ The carrying cost of the extra completion links can be safely
assumed to be very low,
in comparision with the cost of searching for them.
This means that the major consideration in deciding
where to eliminate duplicates,
is time efficiency.
Duplicate completion links should be eliminated
at the point where that elimination can be accomplished
most efficiently.

@** Token code (TOK).
@ Tokens are duples of symbol ID and token value.
They do {\bf not} store location information,
so the same token
can occur many times in a parse.
On the other hand, duplicate tokens are also allowed.
How much, if any, trouble to take to avoid duplication
is up to the application --
duplicates have their cost, but so does the
tracking necessary to avoid them.
@ My strong preference is that token values
{\bf always} be integers, but
token values are |void *|'s to allow applications
full generality.
Using |glib|, integers can portably be stored in a
|void *|, but the reverse is not true.
@ In my prefered semantic scheme, the integers are
used by the higher levels to index the actual data.
In this way no direct pointer to any data "owned"
by the higher level is ever under libmarpa's control.
Problems with mismatches between libmarpa and the
higher levels are almost impossible to avoid in
development
and once an application gets in maintenance mode
things become, if possible, worse.
@ "But," you say, "pointers are faster,
and mismatches occur whether
you index the data with an integer or directly.
So if you are in trouble either way, why not go
for speed?"
\par
The above objection is true, but overlooks a very
important issue.  A bad pointer can cause very
serious problems --
a core dump, or even worse, undetected data corruption.
There is no good way to detect a bad pointer before it
does it's damage.
\par
If an integer index, on the other hand, is out of bounds,
the higher levels can catch this and react.
Worst case, the higher level may have to throw a controlled
fatal error.
This is a much better than a core dump
and far better than undetected data corruption.

@** Read a token alternative.
The ordinary semantics of a parser generator is a token-stream
semantics.
The input is a sequence of $n$ tokens.
Every token is of length 1.
The tokens fill the locations from 0 to $n-1$.
The first token goes into location 0,
the next into location 1,
and so on up to location $n-1$.
@ In Marpa terms, a token-stream
corresponds to reading exactly one token alternative at every location.
In Marpa, the input locations are also called earlemes.
@ Marpa allows other models of the input besides the token stream model.
Tokens may be ambiguous -- that is, more than one token may occur
at any location.
Tokens vary in length -- tokens may be of any length greater than
or equal to one.
This means tokens can span multiple earlemes.
As a consequence,
there may be no tokens at some earlemes.
@*0 Boolean vectors to track terminals.
A number of boolean vectors are used to track
the valued status of terminal symbols.
Whether a symbol is a terminal or not cannot
be changed by the recognizer,
but some symbols are ``value unlocked'' and
will be set to valued or unvalued the first
time they are encountered.

While, if the completion of the earleme left the parse exhausted, 0 is

it is not exhausted.

they must explicitly check the phase whenever this function

@** Create the postdot items.
@ This function inserts regular (non-Leo) postdot items into
the postdot list.
Not inlined, because of its size, and because it is used
twice -- once in initializing the Earley set 0,
and once for completing later Earley sets.
Earley set 0 is very much a special case, and it
might be a good idea to have
separate code to handle it,
in which case both could be inlined.
@ Leo items are not created for Earley set 0.
Originally this was to avoid dealing with the null productions
that might be in Earley set 0.
These have been eliminated with the special-casing of the
null parse.
But Leo items are always optional,
and may not be worth it for Earley set 0.
@ {\bf Further Research}: @^Further Research@>
Another look at the degree and kind
of memoization here will be in order
once the question of when to use Leo items

is completely settled.
This will require making the Leo behavior configurable
and running benchmarks.

@ {\bf To Do}: @^To Do@>
Right now Leo items are created even where there is no
right-recursion.  This follows Leo's original algorithm.
It might be better to restrict the Leo logic to symbols
which actually right-recurse,
eliminating the overhead of tracking the others.
The tradeoff is that the Leo logic may save some space,
even in the absense of right recursion.
It may be a good idea to allow it to be configured,
with a flag determining whether the Leo logic (if enabled
at all) is used for all LHS symbols,
or only where there is right recursion.

@ This code fully populates the data in the LIMs.
It determines the Leo predecesors of the LIMs, if any,
then populates that datum and the predecessor-dependent
data.
@ The algorithm is fast, if not a model of simplicity.
The LIMs are processed in an outer loop in order by
symbol ID, as well as in an inner loop which processes
predecessor chains from bottom to top.
It is very much possible that the
same LIM will be encountered twice,
once in each loop.
The code always checks to see if a LIM is
already populated,
before populating it.
@ The outer loop ensures that all LIMs are eventually
populated.  It uses the PIM workarea, guided by
a boolean vector which indicates the LIM's.
@ It is possible for a LIM to be encountered which may have a predecessor,
but which cannot be immediately populated.
This is because predecessors link the LIMs in chains, and such chains
must be populated in order.
Any ``links" in the chain of LIMs which are in previous Earley sets
will already be populated.
But a chain of LIMs may all be in the current Earley set, the
one we are currently processing.
In this case, there is a chicken-and-egg issue, which is
resolved by arranging those LIMs in chain link order,
and processing them in that order.
This is the business of the inner loop.
@ When a LIM is encountered which cannot be populated immediately,
its chain is followed and copied into |t_lim_chain|, which is in
effect a stack.  The chain ends when it reaches
a LIM which can be populated immediately.
@ A special case is when the LIM chain cycles back to the LIM
which started the chain.
When this happens, the LIM chain is terminated.
The bottom of such a chain
(which, since it is a cycle, is also the top)
is populated with a predecessor of
|NULL| and appropriate predecessor-dependent data.
@ {\bf Theorem}: The number of links
in a LIM chain is never more than the number
of symbols in the grammar.
{\bf Proof}: A LIM chain consists of the predecessors of LIMs,
all of which are in the same Earley set.
A LIM is uniquely determined by a duple of Earley set and transition symbol.
This means, in a single Earley set, there is at most one LIM per symbol.
{\bf QED}.
@ {\bf Complexity}: Time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number
of LIMs.  This can be shown as follows:
\li The outer loop processes each LIM exactly once.
\li A LIM is never put onto a LIM chain if it is already populated.
\li A LIM is never taken off a LIM chain without being populated.
\li Based on the previous two observations, we know that a LIM will
be put onto a LIM chain at most once.
\li Ignoring the inner loop processing, the amount of processing done for each
LIM in the outer loop LIM is $O(1)$.
\li The amount of processing done for each LIM
in the inner loop is $O(1)$.
\li Total processing for all $n$ LIMs is therefore $n(O(1)+O(1))=O(n)$.
@ The |bv_ok_for_chain| is a vector of bits by symbol ID.
A bit is set if there is a LIM for that symbol ID that is OK for addition
to the LIM chain.
To be OK for addition to the LIM chain, the postdot item for the symbol
ID must
\li In fact actually be a Leo item (LIM).
\li Must not have been populated.
\li Must not have already been added to a LIM chain for this
Earley set.\par

@ Find the predecessor LIM from the PIM workarea.
If the predecessor
starts at the current Earley set, I need to look in
the PIM workarea.
Otherwise the PIM item array by symbol is already
set up and I can find it there.
@ The LHS of the completed rule and of the applicable rule
in the base item will be the same, because the two rules
are the same.
Given the |main_loop_symbol_id| we can look up either the
appropriate rule in the base Earley item's AHFA state,
or the Leo completion's AHFA state.
It is most convenient to find the LHS of the completed
rule as the
only possible Leo LHS of the Leo completion's AHFA state.
The AHFA state for the Leo completion is guaranteed
to have only one rule.
The base Earley item's AHFA state can have multiple
rules, and in its list of rules there can
be transitions to Leo
completions via several different symbols.
@ This code only works for unpopulated LIMs,
because it relies on the Top AHFA value containing
the base AHFA to-state.
In a populated LIM, this will not necessarily be the case.

@** Expand the Leo items.
\libmarpa/ expands Leo items on a ``lazy" basis,
when it creates the parse bocage.
Some of the "virtual" Earley items in the Leo paths will also
be real Earley items.
Earley items in the Leo path may actually exist
for several reasons:
\li The Leo completion item itself always exists before
this function call.
It is counted in the total path lengths,
once for each Leo path.
This means that the total of the Leo path lengths will never be less
than the number of Leo paths.
\li Any Leo competion base items.
One of these exists for every path
whose base is a
completed Earley item, and not a token.
\li Any other Earley item in the Leo path item which was already created
for other reasons.
If an Earley item in a Leo path already exists, a new Earley
item is not created ---
instead a source link is added to the present Earley item.

@** Some notes on evaluation.

@*0 Statistics on completed LHS symbols per AHFA state.
An AHFA state may contain completions for more than one LHS,
but that is rare in practical use, and the number of completed
LHS symbols in the exceptions remains low.
The very complex perl AHFA contains 271 states with completions.
Of these 268 have only one completed symbol.
The other three AHFA states complete only two different LHS symbols.
Two states have completions with both
a |term_hi| and a |indirob| on the LHS.
One state has completions for both a
|sideff| and an |mexpr|.
@ My HTML test grammars make the
same point more strongly.
My HTML parser generates grammars on the fly.
These HTML grammars can differ from each other.
because Marpa takes the HTML input into account when
generating the grammar.
In my HTML test suite,
of the 14,782 of the AHFA states, every
single one has only one completed LHS symbol.

@*0 CHAF duplicate and-nodes.
There are three ways in which the same and-node can occur multiple
times as the descendant of a single or-node.
@ First, an or-node can have several different Earley items as
its source.  This is dealt with by noticing that in building the
or-node, we only use the source links of an Earley item, and
that these are always identical.  Therefore we can arbitrarily
select any one of the possible source Earley items to be
the or-node's ``unique" Earley item source.
@ The second source of duplication is duplicate source links
for the same Earley item.
I prevent token source links from duplicating,
and the Leo logic does not allow duplicate Leo source links.
@ Completion source links could be prevented from duplicating by
making the transition symbol part of its ``signature",
and making sure the source link transition symbol matches
the predot symbol of the or-node.
This would only impose a small overhead.
But given that I need to look for duplicates from other
sources, there does not seem to enough of a payoff to justify
even a small overhead.
@ A third source of duplication occurs
when different source links
have different AHFA states in their predecessors; but
share the the same AHFA item.
There will be
pairs of these source links which share the same middle earleme,
because if an AHFA item (dotted rule) in one is justified at a
location, the same AHFA item in the other must be, also.
This happen frequently enough to be an issue even for practical
grammars.

@*0 Sources of Leo path items.
A Leo path consists of a series of Earley items:
\li at the bottom, exactly one Leo base item;
\li at the top, exactly one Leo completion item;
\li in between, zero or more Leo path items.
@ Leo base items and Leo completion items can have a variety
of non-Leo sources.
Leo completion items can have multiple Leo sources,
though no other source can have the same middle earleme
as a Leo source.
@ When expanded, Leo path items can have multiple sources.
However, the sources of a single Leo path item
will result from the same Leo predecessor.
As consequences:
\li All the sources of an expanded Leo path item will have the same
Earley item predecessor,
the Leo base item of the Leo predecessor.
\li All these sources will also have the same middle
earleme, the Earley set of the Leo predecessor.
\li Every source of the Leo path item will have a cause
and the transition symbol of the Leo predecessor
will be on the LHS of at least one completion in all of those causes.
\li The Leo transition symbol will be the postdot symbol in exactly
one AHFA item in the AHFA state of the Earley item predecessor.

@ {\bf Theorem}: If two Earley items are sources of the same or-node,
they have the same links.
{\bf Outline of Proof}:
No or-node results from a predicted Earley
item, so every Earley item which is the source of an or-node
is itself the result of a transition over a symbol from
another Earley item.  
So I can restrict my discussion to discovered Earley items.
For the same reason, I can assume all source links have
predecessors defined.

@ {\bf Shared Predot Lemma}: An AHFA state is either predicted,
or all its LR0 items share the same predot symbol.
{\bf Proof}:  Straightforward, based on the construction of
an AHFA.

@ {\bf EIM Lemma }: If two Earley items are sources of the same or-node,
they share the same origin ES, the same current ES and the same
predot symbol.
{\bf Proof of Lemma}:
Showing that the Earley items share the same origin and current
ES is straightforward, based on the or-node's construction.
They share at least one LR0 item in their AHFA states---%
the LR0 item which defines the or-node.
Because they share at least one LR0 item and because, by the
Shared Predot Lemma, every LR0
item in a discovered AHFA state has the same predot symbol,
the two Earley items also
share the same predot symbol.

@ {\bf Completion Source Lemma}:
A discovered Earley item has a completion source link if and only if
the origin ES of the link's predecessor,
the current ES of the link's cause
and the transition symbol match, respectively,
the origin ES, current ES and predot symbol of the discovered EIM.
{\bf Proof}: Based on the construction of EIMs.

@ {\bf Token Source Lemma}:
A discovered Earley item has a token source link if and only if
origin ES of the link's predecessor, the current ES of the link's cause
and the token symbol match, respectively,
the origin ES, current ES and predot symbol of the discovered EIM.
{\bf Proof}: Based on the construction of EIMs.

@ Source links are either completion source links or token source links.
The theorem for completion source links follows from the EIM Lemma and the
Completion Source Lemma.
The theorem for token source links follows from the EIM Lemma and the
Token Source Lemma.

@ I think the and PSL's and or PSL's are not actually used at the
same time, so the same field might be used for both.
More significantly, a simple $O(n^2)$ sort of the 
draft and-nodes would spot duplicates more efficiently in 99%
of cases, although it would not be $O(n)$ as the PSL's are.
The best of both worlds could be had by using the sort when
there are less than, say, 7 and-nodes, and the PSL's otherwise.
@ The use of PSL's is slightly different here.
The PSL is not needed to find the draft and-nodes -- it's
essentially just a boolean to indicate whether it exists.
But "stale" booleans must still be detected.
The solutiion adopted is to put the parent or-node
into the PSL.
If the PSL contains the current parent or-node,
the draft and-node is a duplicate within that or-node.
Otherwise, it's the first such draft and-node.

@** And-node (AND) code.
The or-nodes are part of the parse bocage.
They are analogous to the and-nodes of a standard parse forest,
except that they are binary -- restricted to two children.
This means that the parse bocage stores the parse in a kind
of Chomsky Normal Form.
As another difference between it and a parse forest,
the parse bocage can contain cycles.

@ Predicted AHFA states can be skipped since they
contain no completions.
Note that AHFA state 0 is not marked as a predicted AHFA state,
even though it can contain a predicted AHFA item.
@ A linear search of the AHFA items is used.
As shown elsewhere in this document,
discovered AHFA states for practical grammars tend to be
very small---%
less than two AHFA items.
Size of the AHFA state is a function of the grammar, so
any reasonable search is $O(1)$ in terms of the length of
the input.
@ The search for the start Earley item is done once
per parse---%
$O(s)$, where $s$ is the size of the end of parse Earley set.
This makes it very hard to justify any precomputations to
help the search, because if they have to be done once per
Earley set, that is a $O(\wsize \cdot s')$ overhead,
where $\wsize$ is the length of the input, and where
$s'$ is the average size of an Earley set.
It is hard to believe that for practical grammars
that $O(\wsize \cdot s') <= O(s)$, which
is what it would take for any per-Earley set overhead
to make sense.

@*0 Set the order of and-nodes.
This function
sets the order in which the and-nodes of an
or-node are used.
It is an error if an and-node ID is not the 
immediate child of the specified or-node,
or if the and-node is specified twice,
or if an ordering has already been specified for
the or-node.
@ For a given bocage,
this function may not be used to order
the same or-node more than once.
In other words, after you have once specified an order
for the and-nodes within an or-node,
you cannot change it.
Some applications might find this inconvenient,
and will have to resort to their own buffering
to prevent multiple changes.
But most applications won't care, and
will benefit from the faster memory allocation
this restriction allows.

@ Using a boolean vector for
the index of an and-node within an or-node,
instead of the and-node ID, would seem to allow
an space efficiency: the size of the boolean vector
could be reduced to the maximum number of descendents
of any or-node.
But in fact, improvements from this approach are elusive.

In the worst cases, these counts are the same, or
almost the same.
Any attempt to economize on space seems to always
be counter-productive in terms of speed.
And since
allocating a boolean vector for the worst case does
not increase the memory high water mark,
it would seems to be the most reasonable tradeoff.

This in turn suggests there is no advantage is using
a within-or-node index to index the boolean vector,
instead of using the and-node id to index the boolean vector.
Using the and-node ID does have the advantage that the bit
vector does not need to be cleared for each or-node.
@ The first position in each |and_node_orderings| array is not
actually an |ANDID|, but a count.
A purist might insist this needs to be reflected in a structure,
but to my mind doing this portably makes the code more obscure,
not less.

The average case (and the root mean square case) in practice
will be small number, and this is probably optimal in those terms.
Note that none of my complexity claims includes the ranking of
ambiguous parses -- that is ``extra''.
\par
For the and-node ranks, I create an array the size of the
bocage's and-node count.
I could arrange, with some trouble, to just create
one the size of the maximum and-node count per or-node.
But there seems to be no advantage of any kind gained for the trouble.
First, it does not help the worst case.
Second, in practice, it does not help with memory issues,
because an array of this size will be created with the tree iterator,
so I am not establishing a memory ''high water mark",
and in that sense the space is ``free''.
And third, computationally, pre-computing
the and-node ranks is fast and easy, so I am gaining real speed
and code-size savings in exchange for the space.

@*0 Tree pause counting.
Trees referenced by an active |VALUE| object
cannot be iterated for the lifetime of that
|VALUE| object.
This is enforced by ``pausing'' the tree.
Because there may be multiple |VALUE| objects
for each |TREE| object,
a pause counter is used.
@ The |TREE| object's pause counter
works much the same as a reference counter.
And the two are tied together.
Every time the pause counter is incremented,
the |TREE| object's reference counter is also
incremented.
Similarly,
every time the pause counter is decremented,
the |TREE| object's reference counter is also
decremented.
For this reason, it is important that every
tree ``pause'' be matched with a ``tree unpause''
@ ``Pausing'' is used because the expected use of
multiple |VALUE| objects is to evaluation a single
tree instance in multiple ways ---
|VALUE| objects are not expected to need to live
into the next iteration of the |TREE| object.
If a more complex relationship between |TREE| objects
and |VALUE| objects becomes desirable, a cloning
mechanism could be introduced.
At this point,
|TREE| objects are iterated directly for efficiency ---
copying the |TREE| iterator to a tree instance would impose
an overhead, one which adds absolutely no value
for most applications.

@** Evaluation (V, VALUE) code.
@ This code helps
compute a value for
a parse tree.
I say ``helps" because evaluating a parse tree
involves semantics, and libmarpa has only
limited knowledge of the semantics.
This code is really just to assist
the higher level in keeping an evaluation stack.
\par
The main reason to have evaluation logic
in libmarpa at all
is to hide libmarpa's
internal rewrites from the semantics.
If it were not for that, it would probably be
just as easy to provide a parse tree to the
higher level and let them decide how to
evaluate it.

stack, but does {\bf not} maintain the

This enables libmarpa to make the rewriting of
the grammar invisible to the semantics.

@*0 Virtual stack.
@ A dynamic stack is used here instead of a fixed
stack for two reasons.
First, there are only a few stack moves per call
of |marpa_v_step|.
Since at least one subroutine call occurs every few
virtual stack moves,
virtual stack moves are not really within a tight CPU
loop.
Therefore shaving off the few instructions it
takes to check stack size is less important than it is
in other places.
@ Second, the fixed stack, to accomodate the worst
case, would have to be many times larger than
what will usually be needed.
My current best bound on the
worst case for virtual stack size is as follows.
\par
The virtual stack only grows once for each virtual
rules.
To be virtual, a rule must divide into a least two
"real" or rewritten, rules, so worst case is half
of all applications of real rules grow the virtual
stack.
The number of applications of real rules is
the size of the parse tree, $\size{|tree|}$.
So, if the fixed stack is sized per tree,
it must be $\size{|tree|}/2+1$.
@ I set the initial size of
the dynamic stack to be
$\size{|tree|}/1024$,
with a minimum of 1024.
1024 is chosen because
in some modern configurations
a smaller allocation may require
extra work.
The purpose of the $\size{|tree|}/1024$ is
to guarantee that this code is $O(n)$.
$\size{|tree|}/1024$ is a fixed fraction
of the worst case size, so the number of
stack reallocations is $O(1)$.

@*0 The RHS closure of a vector.
Despite the fact that they are actually tied closely to their
use in |libmarpa|, most of the logic of boolean vectors has
a ``pure math" appearance.
This routine has a direct connection with the grammar.
\par
Several properties of symbols that need to be determined
have the property that, if
all the symbols on the RHS of any rule have that property,
so does its LHS symbol.
@ The RHS closure looks a lot like the transitive closure,
but there are several major differences.
The biggest difference is that
the RHS closure deals with properties and takes a {\bf vector} to another
vector;
the transitive closure is for a relation and takes a transition {\bf matrix}
to another transition matrix.
@ There are two properties of the RHS closure to note.
First, it is reflexive.
Any symbol in a set is in the RHS closure of that set.
@ Second, the RHS closure is vacuously true.
For any RHS closure property,
every symbol which is on the LHS of an empty rule has that property.
This means the RHS closure operation can only be used for
properties which can meaningfully be regarded as vacuously
true.
In |libmarpa|, two important symbol properties are
RHS closure properties:
the property of being productive,
and the property of being nullable.

@*0 Produce the RHS closure of a vector.

@** Boolean matrixes.
Marpa's boolean matrixes are implemented differently
from the matrixes in
Steffen Beyer's Bit-Vector package on CPAN,
but like Beyer's matrixes are build on that package.
Beyer's matrixes are a single boolean vector
which special routines index by row and column.
Marpa's matrixes are arrays of vectors.

Since there are ``hidden words" before the data
in each vectors, Marpa must repeat these for each
row of a vector.  Consequences:
\li Marpa matrixes use a few extra bytes per row of space.
\li Marpa's matrix pointers cannot be used as vectors.
\li Marpa's rows {\bf can} be used as vectors.
\li Marpa's matrix pointers point to the beginning of
the allocated space.  |Bit_Vector| pointers use trickery
and include ``hidden words" before the pointer.

and |Bit_Vector| are identical.

@** Efficient stacks and queues.
@ The interface for these macros is somewhat hackish,
in that the user often
must be aware of the implementation of the
macros.
Arguably, using these macros is not
all that easier than
hand-writing each instance.
But the most important goal was safety -- by
writing this stuff once I have a greater assurance
that it is tested and bug-free.
Another important goal was that there be
no compromise on efficiency,
when compared to hand-written code.

|libmarpa| uses stacks and worklists extensively.
This stack interface resizes itself dynamically.
There are two disadvantages.

\li There is more overhead ---
overflow must be checked for with each push,
and the resizings, while fast, do take time.

\li The stack may be moved after any |DSTACK_PUSH|
operation, making all pointers into it invalid.
Data must be retrieved from the stack before the
next |DSTACK_PUSH|.
In the special 2-argument form,
|DSTACK_INIT2|, the stack is initialized
to a size convenient for the memory allocator.

@** Per-Earley-set list (PSL) code.
There are several cases where Marpa needs to
look up a triple $\langle s,s',k \rangle$,
where $s$ and $s'$ are earlemes, and $0<k<n$,
where $n$ is a reasonably small constant,
such as the number of AHFA items.
Earley items, or-nodes and and-nodes are examples.
@ Lookup for Earley items needs to be $O(1)$
to justify Marpa's time complexity claims.
Setup of the parse
bocage for evaluation is not
parsing in the strict sense,
but makes sense to have it meet the same time complexity claims.
@
To obtain $O(1)$,
Marpa uses a special data structure, the Per-Earley-Set List.
The Per-Earley-Set Lists rely on the following being true:
\li It can be arranged so
that only one $s'$ is being considered at a time,
so that we are in fact looking up a duple $\langle s,k \rangle$.
\li In all cases of interest
we will have pointers available that take
us directly to all of the
Earley sets involved,
so that lookup of the data for an Earley set is $O(1)$.
\li The value of $k$ is always less than a constant.
Therefore any reasonable algorithm
for the search and insertion of $k$ is $O(1)$.
@ The idea is that each Earley set has a list of values
for all the keys $k$.
We arrange to consider only one Earley set $s$ at a time.
A pointer takes us to the Earley set $s'$ in $O(1)$ time.
Each Earley set has a list of values indexed by $k$.
Since this list is of a size less than a constant,
search and insertion in it is $O(1)$.
Thus each search and insertion for the triple
$\langle s,s',k \rangle$ takes $O(1)$ time.
@ In understanding how the PSL's are used, it is important
to keep in mind that the PSL's are kept in Earley sets as
a convenience, and that the semantic relation of the Earley set
to the data structure being tracked by the PSL is not important
in the choice of where the PSL goes.
All data structures tracked by PSL's belong
semantically more to
the Earley set of their dot earleme than any other,
but for the time complexity hack to work,
that must be held constand while another Earley set is
the one which varies.
In the case of Earley items and or-nodes, the varying
Earley set is the origin.
In the case of and-nodes, the origin Earley set is also
held constant, and the Earley set of the middle earleme
is the variable.
@ The PSL's are kept in a linked list.
Each contains |Size_of_PSL| |void *|'s.
|t_owner| is the address of the location
that ``owns" this PSL.
That location will be NULL'ed
when deallocating.

@** Memory allocation.

@*0 Memory allocation failures.
@ By default,
a memory allocation failure
inside the Marpa library is a fatal error.
At some point I may allow this to be reset.
What else an application can do is not at all clear,
which is why the usual practice 
is to treatment memory allocation errors are
fatal, irrecoverable problems.
These functions all return |void*| in order
to avoid compiler warnings about void returns.
@<Function definitions@> =
PRIVATE_NOT_INLINE void*
_marpa_default_out_of_memory(void)
{
    abort();
}
void* (*_marpa_out_of_memory)(void) = _marpa_default_out_of_memory;

@ @<Utility variables@> =
extern void* (*_marpa_out_of_memory)(void);

@*0 Obstacks.
|libmarpa| uses the system malloc,
either directly or indirectly.
Indirect use comes via obstacks.
Obstacks are more efficient, but 
limit the ability to resize memory,
and to control the lifetime of the memory.
@ Obstacks are widely used inside |libmarpa|.
Much of the memory allocated in |libmarpa| is
\li In individual allocations less than 4K, often considerable less.
\li Once created, are kept for the entire life of the either the grammar or the recognizer.
\li Once created, is never resized.
For these, obstacks are perfect.
|libmarpa|'s grammar has an obstacks.
Small allocations needed for the lifetime of the grammar
are allocated on these as the grammar object is built.
All these allocations are are conveniently and quickly deallocated when
the grammar's obstack is destroyed along with its parent grammar.

@*0 Why the obstacks are renamed.
Regretfully, I realized I simply could not simply include the
GNU obstacks, because of three obstacles.
First, the error handling is not thread-safe.  In fact,
since it relies on a global error handler, it is not even
safe for use by multiple libraries within one thread.
Since
the obstack ``error handling" consisted of exactly one
``out of memory" message, which Marpa will never use because
it uses |my_malloc|, this risk comes at no benefit whatsoever.
Removing the error handling was far easier than leaving it
in.

@ Second, there were also portability complications
caused by the unneeded features of obstacks.
\li The GNU obtacks had a complex set of |ifdef|'s intended
to allow the same code to be part of GNU libc,
or not part of it, and the portability aspect of these
was daunting.
\li GNU obstack's lone error message was dragging in
GNU's internationalization.
(|libmarpa| avoids internationalization by leaving all
messaging and naming to the higher layers.)
It was far easier to rip out these features than to
deal with the issues they raised,
especially the portability
issues.

@ Third, if I did choose to try to use GNU obstacks in its
original form, |libmarpa| would have to deal with issues
of interposing identical function names in the linking process.
I aim at portability, even to systems that I have no
direct access to.
This is, of course, a real challenge when
it comes to debugging.
It was not cheering to think of the prospect
of multiple
libraries with obstack functions being resolved by the linkers
of widely different systems.
If, for example, a function that I intended to be used was not the
one linked, the bug would usually be a silent one.

@ Porting to systems with no native obstack meant that I was
already in the business of maintaining my own obstacks code,
whether I liked it or not.
The only reasonable alternative seemed to be
to create my own version of obstacks,
essentially copying the GNU implementation,
but eliminating the unnecessary
but problematic features.
Namespace issues could then be dealt with by
renaming the external functions.

@*0 Memory allocation.
libmarpa wrappers the standard memory functions
to provide more convenient behaviors.
\li The allocators do not return on failed memory allocations.
\li |my_realloc| is equivalent to |my_malloc| if called with
a |NULL| pointer.  (This is the GNU C library behavior.)
@ {\bf To Do}: @^To Do@>
For the moment, the memory allocators are hard-wired to
the C89 default |malloc| and |free|.
At some point I may allow the user to override
these choices.

@<Utility static functions@> =
static inline
void my_free (void *p)
{
  free (p);
}

@ The macro is defined because it is sometimes needed
to force inlining.
@<Utility static functions@> =

@*0 Slices.
I once used the "slice" allocator to handle
the "middle ground" between the flexibity of the
system malloc,
and the efficiency of obstacks.
But there turned out to not even "middle ground"
to justify a third memory allocation scheme.
I now simply
pass all calls to the "slice" allocator
on to the system malloc.
@d my_slice_alloc(size) my_malloc(size)
@d my_slice_new(x) my_malloc(sizeof(x))
@d my_slice_free(x, p) my_free(p)
@d my_slice_free1(size, p) my_free(p)

@** External failure reports.
Most of
|libmarpa|'s external functions return failure under
one or more circumstances --- for
example, they may have been called incorrectly.
Many of the external routines share failure logic in
common.
I found it convenient to gather much of this logic here.
All the logic in this section expects |failure_indication|
to be set in the scope in which it is used.
All failures treated in this section are hard failures.

@ Routines returning pointers typically use |NULL| as
both the soft and hard failure indicator.

@ The central error routine for the recognizer.
There are two flags which control its behavior.
One flag makes a error recognizer-fatal.
When there is a recognizer-fatal error, all
subsequent
invocations of external functions for that recognizer
object will fail.
It is a design goal of libmarpa to leave as much discretion
about error handling to the higher layers as possible.
Because of this, even the most severe errors
are not necessarily made recognizer-fatal.
|libmarpa| makes an
error recognizer-fatal only when the integrity of the
recognizer object is so thorougly compromised
that |libmarpa|'s external functions cannot proceed
without risking internal memory errors,
such as bus errors and segment violations.
``Recognizer-fatal" status is thus,
not a means of dictating to the higher layers that a
|libmarpa| condition must be application-fatal,
but a way of preventing a recognizer error from becoming
application-fatal without the application's consent.
@d FATAL_FLAG (0x1u)
@ Several convenience macros are provided.
These are easier and less error-prone
than specifying the flags.
Not being error-prone
is important since there are many calls to |r_error|
in the code.

@d MARPA_ERROR(code) (set_error(g, (code), NULL, 0u))
@d MARPA_FATAL(code) (set_error(g, (code), NULL, FATAL_FLAG))
@ Not inlined.  |r_error|
occurs in the code quite often,
but |r_error|
should actually be invoked only in exceptional circumstances.
In this case space clearly is much more important than speed.

@** File layout.  
@ The output files are {\bf not} source files,
but I add the license to them anyway,
as close to the top as possible.
@ Also, it is helpful to someone first
trying to orient herself,
if built source files contain a comment
to that effect and a warning
not that they are
not intended to be edited directly.
So I add such a comment.
